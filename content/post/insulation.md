## Who is this for?

First things first, this post is intended to help educate homeowners with general information so that they empowered to make decisions based on thier personal needs and budget. 

If you want to dive deeper into this subject I will include some links as I go to point you in the right direction, but I also encourage you to speak with a professional when choosing the right materials for your project. A wall/roof/floor is an assembly and must work in concert with the other materials in that assembly to perform well. 

'Performance' is not just energy effieciency, but also long term sustainabilty and reducing opportunities health hazards to thrive such as mold.

## What is insulation?

In the simplist, building construction terms, insulation is a plysical material that reduces/slows the transmission of environmental elements through an assembly. In construction we are typically refering to heat and noise transmission.

For example, if the temperature on the interior face of a wall assembly is 20&deg;C (68&deg;F) and the temperature on the exterior face of that wall assembly is -20&deg;C (-4&deg;F), then that means that the change of temeperature (or Delta) that occures through that wall assembly is 40&deg;C (72&deg;F).

Now for reasons of thermal comfort, we continue to heat the interior side of that assembly to maintain a temperature of 20&deg;C (68&deg;F). Since heat always moves towards cold, that heating energy you used and paid for is always moving through your walls and out into the world. Without a stretegy to slow the rate of heat loss through this assembly this can get very expensive.

This is where using insulation comes in.  It is a material that we include in our wall/roof/floor assemblies to slow the rate of heat loss (in the winter and heat gain in the summer) to maintain thermal comfort withing our building envelopes and reduce the cost of doing so.

There are many types and manufacturers of insulation which we will discuss in Part 2, but before we get to that...

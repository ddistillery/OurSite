## Who is this for?

First things first, this post is intended to help educate homeowners with general information so that they empowered to make decisions based on thier personal needs and budget. 

If you want to dive deeper into this subject I will include some links as I go to point you in the right direction, but I also encourage you to speak with a professional when embarking down this path.  This is a big move and you really want a team by your side to help you navigate it.

Though we do provide these services, the intent of these blog posts are to give you unbiased information to help reduce the fear inherint to this process through education. 

The advice I will give is to make sure that you are comfortible enough with the team you choose that you can have open and honest discussions regarding your project goals and your budget throughout this process.  There are almost always bumps and turns in the road and you need to have confidence in your team to get you through it.

## A roadmap to developing your design and getting your permits: 

1. Figure out what you are working with.
- If you don't already have a site **Survey** (signed and dated by an Ontario Land Surveyor), you will need one.
- **Zoning**. With the survey in hand you can now start to explore the Zoning ByLaws for your site and get a clearer picture from a massing point of view what you can actually fit on your site.  If your goals for the design of your projects extend beyond the limitations laid out in Zoning for your site, then your road to getting a permit will get a little longer as you will need to present your case to the local Committee of Adjustment.
- Design
    - Be realistic
- Submit your design for a Zoning review
- Zoning Certificate or Zoning Notice
- Committee of Adjustment
- TLAB
- Design Revision?
- Building Permit 

Ok, maybe we are over simplifying, but that is why you hire a team to get you through this part of the process in one piece with your relationships intact.  The cariest part is making the first move. When you are ready to take that step, find a team that you feel comfortable with and take it!

## What is the next step? 

You don't have to wait until your Permit is in hand to start the following: 
- Find a builder
    - vet that builder
- Secure your financing...start this early so you have that sense of security and can set your goals accordingly.



## Remeber to keep your head and use your team. You will get through this!

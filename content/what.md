We wear many hats in this office. Much of this stems from a broad base of root interests and experience that has grown and enriched as we have advanced in our professional careers. 


#### **These are some of the hats we wear the most around here:** 

# Architecture
- ## RESIDENTIAL
  - **SINGLE FAMILY**
    - Typically this falls into two categories (new builds and renovations/additions):
      * **New build**
        - You have a site and you want to build a house or would like to tear down an existing house and replace it with a new one.
      * **Renovation / Addition**
        - You have an existing house that is just not working for you. You can reconfigure it, or you can potentially extend your living space outward or even upward.
  - **DUAL FAMILY**
    - A trend we are seeing more of with the skyrocketing cost of real estate.
    - Two families are buying a house together and reconfiguring it to contain two separate units with the potential to share the space load for utility and storage common spaces.
  - **MULTI FAMILY**
    - Typically this falls into the realm of developers and if you are one you likely know what you want and need. 
    - However, some ambitious potential homeowners who do not accept that they have been priced out of the real estate market are looking for ways to forge a path forward. With pooled resources and a sense of unconventional adventure there are some really interesting opportunities to be found. We would love to dig into the details with you and help you navigate the terrain.
    <!-- There are also many old urban rooming houses that are slowly being converted by investors into single family dwellings. There are other ways forward that can still turn investors a profit when executed well. If you have existing multi-unit status already grandfathered-in why wouldn't you take full advantage of the value in that? We can help you investigate what is possible and design you a solution that leverages the added value inherent in your legal-non-conforming status.-->

- ## COMMERCIAL
  *This is a broad area as well. However, if you are looking at this section you likely already have some previous experience we can build on. However if this is your first time designing and building out your new commercial space don't worry, we will work with you whether you are a landlord or tenant. We will take you through concept to opening and everything in between.*
  - Office fit-outs
    - Whether a small modification or a complete redesign of a space we can plan your space to make it look seamless. We can also help you achieve all the latest health and safety requirements we face in today’s office spaces.
  - Retail infrastructure
    - If you are a Landlord with a dated retail property and are looking to refresh or upgrade it in any way, we can help you plan out and execute a refreshed plan for the property that will bring it to the present day with an understanding of the future needs of your building.
  - Retail fit-outs
    - Whether you are a Landlord or a Tenant we can help you through planning, design and construction phases of a project.
    - If you have multiple locations we can also work with you to create fixtures and furniture that speak to your brand and can be used cohesively across locations.
  - Hospitality
    - Restaurants
    - Cafe
    - Boutique Hotels

- ## INDUSTRIAL
  *We won't spend too much time on this because it is such a rare animal, but if you have a small business that would like to begin manufacturing within the urban fabric of the City in the dwindling industrial zones, call us and let's work through designing a space to suit your needs and budget. These types of spaces and communities are vital to our neighbourhoods and shouldn't all slowly be rezoned for another condo tower.*

- ## COORDINATION
  - We work and coordinate with all types of consultants whenever it is required or necessary consultant expertise is needed.
    - Why spread yourself out playing all of the positions when you can assemble a dream team?
  - We have worked with some really great engineers and other consultants whose creative problem solving skills and experience have proved vital to every project. 
  - Coordination with these consultants should start early enough in the design process to be integral rather than an after-thought, and will continue well into construction.

# Industrial Design

- ## Custom Furniture and Millwork Design

  - This is a service that we sometimes provide our residential and commercial clients. However, if you already have the canvas we would be happy to design the pieces to populate them for you. There are many options for fabricating/manufacturing them depending on the scale and budget, but we can help you navigate that as well using our existing contacts or helping you vet new ones.

  - Do you want to design custom line of furniture pieces that you would like to market and sell? Do you need to find or vet a manufacturer? We can help you with this as well.

- ## Personal and Consumer Products

  - Small pieces such as custom millwork pulls to help you truly customize your home.

  - We can help you translate a product idea that has been rattling around in your head into set of resolved design drawings, 3D models, and renderings.
    - Whether it's a kitchen gadget with minimal moving parts
    - Or a beautiful form to house your Startup's newest innovation.
  - We can also prototype your design to help resolve it in hand at 1:1 scale, tweak it further, and use to help get your product to market.
  - Packaging. Your shiny new product will probably need something to protect it as it ships from Point A to B to your Customer. We can help you design that as well.
    - We prefer to design packaging in a manner than minimalizes environmental impact where possible.
  - We can also help you find or vet a manufacturer when you are ready for production.

# Building Science
  *This sounds like a no-brainer when it comes to designing your forever home…however, in our experience performance within the walls/floors/roof assemblies is the first thing that gets cut in the construction budget in favour of more expensive surface material finishes that will be seen. Unfortunately it is a lot more difficult talking a client into investing in the performance of their home than it is to talk them out of it. The science and building materials are evolving at a much  faster rate than minimum code. Since the work of implementing performance materials and strategies is often tedious and are typically hidden within the walls, please consider that there may be potential biases when being talked out of them and remember that you and your families will be the ones actually living in those spaces for the long term. We sit down with our clients and have a frank discussion about budgets and guide them on important places to invest.*

- **Performance Materials and Assembly Design**

- **Reduced Environmental Impact / Energy Savings over the Life of the Building**

- **Research and Theory are a great place to start but we also like to Test and Tighten during construction**

# Pre-purchase Assessments

*Did you find a house in a neighbourhood that you love and really want and are considering making an offer but are worried about what you can build on that location or if there are any other benefits/issues that you are likely not seeing in the listing...we can help you quickly dig deeper*

- **What we can help define for you:**
  - Current Zoning
  - Current Open Permits
  - Existing Easements and Rights-of-Way over the property
  - Property areas, setbacks, height restrictions, allowable coverage.
    - What can you potentially build there and stay within the Zoning ByLaw
    - What will push you over what is allowed and may require Committee of Adjustment approval.
  - Is any part of the property protected (Urban Forestry; Ravine; Archeological Significant area) in a manner that could affect your plans to build?

- If you do purchase the home and would like to hire us for the remainder of the design and permit work we would be happy to apply all applicable fees as credit towards that work.

We wear many hats in this office. Much of this is stems from a broad base of root interests and experience that has grown and enrichened as we have advanced in our professional careers. 

These are some of the hats we wear the most around here:

## Architecture

- **Residential**
  - This is a broad term.

- **Commercial**
  - Also broad

- **Coordination**
  - We work with consultants whenever it can help the project.
    - Why spread yourself out playing all of the positions when you can assemble a dream team?

## Industrial Design

- **custom furniture and millwork design**

  - one-off

  - mass production

- **products**

  - one-off

  - mass production


## Building Science
  *This sounds like a no-brainer when it comes to designing your forever home...however, in our experience sound better performance within the walls is the first thing that gets cut for more expensive material finishes that will been seen. The science develops faster than minimum code. We sit down with our clients and have a frank discussion about budgets and guide them on important places to invest.*

- **performance materials and assembly design**

- **reduced environmental impact**

- **research and theory are a great place to start but we also like to test**

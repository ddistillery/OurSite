We wear many hats in this office. Much of this is stems from a broad base of root interests and experience that has grown and enrichened as we have advanced in our professional careers. 

These are some of the hats we wear the most around here:

# Architecture
- ### RESIDENTIAL
  - **SINGLE FAMILY**
    - Typically this falls into two categories (new builds and renovations/additions):
      * **New build**
        - You have a site that you want to build a house on or you would like to replace an existing house.
      * **Renovation / Addition**
        - You have an existing house that is just not working for you personal or family needs. You can reconfigure the building envelope you have now, or you could also potentially extend your living space outward or even upward.
  - **DUAL FAMILY**
    - This is a trend we are seeing more of with the skyrocketing cost of real estate. Two families are buying a house together and reconfiguring it to contain two seperate units with the potential to split the space load for utility and storage common spaces.  
  - **MULTI FAMILY**
    - Typically this falls into the realm of developers

---
- ### Commercial
  - Also broad

---
- ### Coordination
  - We work with consultants whenever it can help the project.
    - Why spread yourself out playing all of the positions when you can assemble a dream team?



# Industrial Design

- **custom furniture and millwork design**

  - Have you ever wanted....one-off

  - mass production

- **products**

  - one-off

  - mass production


# Building Science
  *This sounds like a no-brainer when it comes to designing your forever home...however, in our experience sound better performance within the walls is the first thing that gets cut for more expensive material finishes that will been seen. The science develops faster than minimum code. We sit down with our clients and have a frank discussion about budgets and guide them on important places to invest.*

- **performance materials and assembly design**

- **reduced environmental impact**

- **research and theory are a great place to start but we also like to test**


# Pre-purchase Assessments *(fast!)*

*Did you find a house in a neighbourrhood that you love and really want to put an offer in on but are worried aboiut what you can build on that location or if thee are any other benefits/issues that you are likely not seeing in the listing...we can dig deeper than most*

- **What we would look for:**
  - Current Zoning
  - Current Open Permits
  - existing Easments and Rights-of-Way over that property
  - Property areas, setbacks, height resetrictions, allowable coverage.
    - What can you potentially build there and stay within the Zoning ByLaw
    - What will push you over what is allowed and may require Committee of Adjustmet approval.
  - Is any part of the property protected (Urban Forestry; Ravine; Archeological Significant area) in a manner that could affect your plans to build?

- **We will credit you all fees paid!** If you do purchase the home and would like to hire us for the remainder of the design and permit work we would be happy to apply all applicable fees as credit towards that work.

We wear many hats in this office. Much of this is stems from a broad base of root interests and experience that has grown and enrichened as we have advanced in our professional careers. 

**These are some of the hats we wear the most around here** *(without trying to emphasize the ones we would like to wear more of)***:**

# Architecture
- ### RESIDENTIAL
  - **SINGLE FAMILY**
    - Typically this falls into two categories (new builds and renovations/additions):
      * **New build**
        - You have a site that you want to build a house on or you would like to replace an existing house.
      * **Renovation / Addition**
        - You have an existing house that is just not working for you personal or family needs. You can reconfigure the building envelope you have now, or you could also potentially extend your living space outward or even upward.
  - **DUAL FAMILY**
    - This is a trend we are seeing more of with the skyrocketing cost of real estate. Two families are buying a house together and reconfiguring it to contain two seperate units with the potential to split the space load for utility and storage common spaces.  
  - **MULTI FAMILY**
    - Typically this falls into the realm of developers, however some ambitious potential homeowners do not accept that they have been priced out of the real estate market and forge a path forward. With pooled resourses and a sense of unconventional adventure there are some real interesting optorunities to be found. Give us a call if you are part of one of these groups. We would love to dig in with you and help you navigate the terain.
    - There are also many old urban rooming houses that are slowly being convered by investors into single family dwellings. There are other ways forward that can still turn investors a profit when executed well. If you have existing multi-unit status already grandfathered-in why wouldn't you take full advantage of the value in that? We can help you investigate what is possible and design you a solution that leverages the added value inherint in your legal-non-conforming status.

- ### COMMERCIAL
  *This is a broad area as well. If you are looking at this section you likely already have some previous experience we can build on. However if this is your first time designing and building our your new commercial space don't worry, we will work with you to get from concept to opening.*
  - Office fitouts
  - Retail infrastructure
  - Retail spaces
    - If you have mutiple locations we can also work with you to create fixtures and furniture that speak to your brand and can be used cohesively across locations
  - Hospitality
    - Hotel
    - Food and beverage spaces

---
- ### INDUSTRIAL
  *We won't spend too much time on this because it is such a rare animal, but if you have small business that would like to begin manufactururing within the urban fabric of the City in the dwindlinging industrial zones, call us and let's work through designing you a space to suit your needs and budget. These types of spaces and communities are vital to our neighbourhoods and shouldn't all slowly be rezoned for another condo tower.* 


---
- ### Coordination
  - We work with consultants whenever it can help the project.
    - Why spread yourself out playing all of the positions when you can assemble a dream team?
  - We have worked with some really great Structural and Mechanical Engineers whose creativite problem solving skills and experience are vital to every project. 
  - Coordination with these consultants should start early enough in the design process to be integral rather than an after-though, and will continue well into contruction.



# Industrial Design

- **custom furniture and millwork design**

  - This is a service that we sometimes provide our residential and commercial clients. However if you already have the canvas we would be happy to design the pieces to populate them for you. There are many options for fabricating/manufacturing them depending on the scale and budget, but we can help you navigate that as well using our existing contacts or helping you vet new ones.

  - mass production

- **products**

  - one-off

  - mass production


# Building Science
  *This sounds like a no-brainer when it comes to designing your forever home...however, in our experience sound better performance within the walls is the first thing that gets cut for more expensive material finishes that will been seen. The science develops faster than minimum code. We sit down with our clients and have a frank discussion about budgets and guide them on important places to invest.*

- **performance materials and assembly design**

- **reduced environmental impact**

- **research and theory are a great place to start but we also like to test**


# Pre-purchase Assessments *(fast!)*

*Did you find a house in a neighbourrhood that you love and really want to put an offer in on but are worried aboiut what you can build on that location or if thee are any other benefits/issues that you are likely not seeing in the listing...we can dig deeper than most*

- **What we would look for:**
  - Current Zoning
  - Current Open Permits
  - existing Easments and Rights-of-Way over that property
  - Property areas, setbacks, height resetrictions, allowable coverage.
    - What can you potentially build there and stay within the Zoning ByLaw
    - What will push you over what is allowed and may require Committee of Adjustmet approval.
  - Is any part of the property protected (Urban Forestry; Ravine; Archeological Significant area) in a manner that could affect your plans to build?

- **We will credit you all fees paid!** If you do purchase the home and would like to hire us for the remainder of the design and permit work we would be happy to apply all applicable fees as credit towards that work.

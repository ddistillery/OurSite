We save the sugar-coating for our donuts; **Design Distillery is a design studio that believes in shooting straight and having fun.** We take the practice and the rigor of design very seriously. However, we believe that truly compelling, engaging, and fun designs cannot be achieved in a sterile environment; they need additional life infused into them throughout the process. These intangible elements are really the secret sauce - the soul of our projects - which we nurture into our design process by maintaining  a positive and fun studio energy which percolates into the work itself.

After first meeting in the Master of Architecture program as trailblazers in the alpha class at Ryerson Univeristy in Toronto, Jorge and Mark's paths forked individually building careers in different design offices across the city. Design Distillery was born as an opportunity to pool our combined experiences and enrich them with positive fun energy whenever and as often as possible.

<!--Relationships are important to us. We believe in the old school philosophy that you should treat others as you would like them to treat you. We have cultivated some really great and long lasting relationships over our proffessional careers. When those relationships click and everyone speaks eye to eye you develop a broadenening network of respect and trust that continue to pay off and enrich our lives.-->

## We break down problems, develop design strategies, and produce detailed documents on how to execute them.

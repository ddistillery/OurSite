If you have clicked on this page then we are optimistic that you have a project and would like to see how our past work aligns with your style, scale, and ambition for it.  

<!--
Please [contact us](mailto:contact@design-distillery.ca) and let's talk a bit about what you would like to do so we can tailor a package of past projects best suited for you. 
Then let's follow up and talk about it some more.
-->

**Please [contact us](mailto:contact@design-distillery.ca) for examples of our work, and we will send you a package aligned with what you are looking to do with your own project.**

Having 'the right fit' with our clients is equally important to us. In the spirit of cultivating great working relationships we are committed to investing our time into these early discussions. So let's talk. We will learn about you and your project, you will learn about us and at the very least get some direction that you didn't have before picking up the phone.

### Are we a good fit for you?

- So you want to do something interesting, but now what?  Is your home no longer working for you (or did it ever)?  Is it a small tweak or do you want to start from scratch?  
> [**We should talk.**](mailto:contact@design-distillery.ca)


- Do you want a completely tailored solution down to every material choice? Or, do you just need a design that works and a building permit so you and your builder can pick up from there? Are you somewhere in between?  
> [**We should talk.**](mailto:contact@design-distillery.ca)

- Do you have an idea for a custom piece of furniture or built-in or want custom door knobs or cabinet pulls?  
> [**We should talk.**](mailto:contact@design-distillery.ca)

- You don't know what you want yet, but want some guidance.  
> [**We should talk.**](mailto:contact@design-distillery.ca)

- Do you want something cookie-cutter that is the same as your neighbours and friends?  
> ***You should call someone else!***  
>> However, if you want a custom design solution that reflects your personal tastes, is organized to suit the way you want to live and work, and is targeted to match your goals and budget, then you have come to the right place.

## Are we a good fit?

> So you want to do something interesting, but now what?  Is you home no longer working for you (or did it ever)?  Is it a small tweak or do you want to start from scratch?  
>> [**We should talk.**](mailto:contact@design-distillery.ca)


> Do you want a completely tailored solution down to every material choice?  Or do you just need a design that wooks and a building permit so you and your builder can pick up from there? Are you somewhere in between?  
>> [**We should talk.**](mailto:contact@design-distillery.ca)

> Do you have an idea for a custom piece of furnature or built-in or want custom door knobs or cabinet pulls?  
>> [**We should talk.**](mailto:contact@design-distillery.ca)

> You don't know what you want yet, but want some guidence.  
>> [**We should talk.**](mailto:contact@design-distillery.ca)

> Do you want something cookie-cutter that is the same as your neighbours and friends?  
> ***You should call someone else!***  
> However, if you want a custom design solution that reflects your personal tastes, is organized to suit the way you want to live and work, and is targeted to match your goals and budget, then you have come to the right place.
